python-cmdline-bootstrap
========================

This is a structure template for Python command line applications, ready to be
released and distributed via setuptools/PyPI/pip for Python 2 and 3.

Please have a look at the corresponding article:
http://gehrcke.de/2014/02/distributing-a-python-command-line-application/


Usage
-----

Clone this repository and adopt the bootstrap structure for your own project.
This is just a starting point, but I hope a good one. From there on, you should
read and follow https://packaging.python.org/,
the definite resource on Python packaging.



Behavior
--------

Flexible invocation
*******************

The application can be run right from the source directory, in different
ways:

1) Treating the bootstrap directory as a package *and* as the main script::

    $ python -m bootstrap arg1 arg2
    Executing bootstrap version 0.2.0.
    List of argument strings: ['arg1', 'arg2']
    Stuff and Boo():
    <class 'bootstrap.stuff.Stuff'>
    <bootstrap.bootstrap.Boo object at 0x7f43d9f65a90>

2) Using ``setup.py develop`` (documented `here <https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/development_mode.html>`_)::

    # This installs the bootstrap command linking back
    # to the current checkout, quite neat for development!
    $ python setup.py develop
    ...
    $ bootstrap arg1 arg2


3) Using the bootstrap-runner.py wrapper::

    $ ./bootstrap-runner.py arg1 arg2
    Executing bootstrap version 0.2.0.
    List of argument strings: ['arg1', 'arg2']
    Stuff and Boo():
    <class 'bootstrap.stuff.Stuff'>
    <bootstrap.bootstrap.Boo object at 0x7f149554ead0>


Installation sets up bootstrap command
**************************************

Situation before installation::

    $ bootstrap
    bash: bootstrap: command not found

Installation right from the source tree (or via pip from PyPI)::

    $ python setup.py install

Now, the ``bootstrap`` command is available::

    $ bootstrap arg1 arg2
    Executing bootstrap version 0.2.0.
    List of argument strings: ['arg1', 'arg2']
    Stuff and Boo():
    <class 'bootstrap.stuff.Stuff'>
    <bootstrap.bootstrap.Boo object at 0x7f366749a190>


On Unix-like systems, the installation places a ``bootstrap`` script into a
centralized ``bin`` directory, which should be in your ``PATH``. On Windows,
``bootstrap.exe`` is placed into a centralized ``Scripts`` directory which
should also be in your ``PATH``.
